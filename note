about note
notes are from
0 - 7
if mustHitSection is true
0 - 3 is for bf
else
0 - 3 is for opponent

bpm : beats per minute

100 bpm means
    100 bpm : 100 beat/m
    100 beat = 60 * 1000 millis

    1 beat = 600 millis

song speed determines arrow interval

I think for this application to run faster it needs to run 1000 times per senconds

currently, audio reports interval of 10ms... which is not good

TODOS

moving through song should be in pixels instead of time
using scroll wheel to scroll through song

after playing the song show user what note they hit miss etc....
report miss bad good sick like fnf
change note arrow to match fnf style better
changing songs
ability to scan directory and get song list
